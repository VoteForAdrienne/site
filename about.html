								<h2>About Adrienne</h2>
								<p>As a mother, wife, daughter, friend, humanitarian, and scientist, Adrienne is an “essential worker.” Throughout her
								career, social justice has always been fundamental and central: Adrienne envisions and champions an equitable world for
								everyone. Adrienne is running for City Council in order to help create and sustain our best future together in
								Cambridge.
								<br />
								<br />
								Born and raised in Central Massachusetts, from an early age Adrienne was exposed to and involved in political activism
								by her two social worker parents. They promoted the rights of children and people with disabilities, and energetically
								supported female candidates for offices at all levels of government. Inspired by an aunt who had lived and worked in
								South America, Adrienne began studying Spanish early on, continued to do so while studying abroad, and now regularly
								uses her fluent Spanish professionally.
								<br />
								<br />
								As an undergraduate at Smith College, Adrienne spent time studying in Argentina, where she worked with the Argentine
								Forensic Anthropology Team identifying remains of victims of violence, as well as with women who were typically
								dismissed as “crazy” because they were searching for their “disappeared” relatives. She became interested in the
								intersection of fact creation and justice, distinguishing who was an expert, what counted as evidence, and why in the
								court of law. Shortly after graduating from Smith, Adrienne had the opportunity to continue her work in Argentina with a
								Fulbright Research Fellowship.
								<br />
								<br />
								Upon returning to Massachusetts, Adrienne worked for Project Bread, connecting Spanish-speaking residents from across
								the state to food resources in their communities. Her next career move brought her to Cambridge Community Services (now
								Enroot), working with recent immigrant students on academic and civic engagement in their new community. She also became
								involved in the College Success Initiative, spearheading a program for community college students, which expanded
								Cambridge Community Services’ programming to a broader population including non-immigrant, low-income students who were
								struggling academically. Cambridge Community Services continued to run the College Success Initiative for two years,
								after which it was transferred to the City of Cambridge where it has been successfully housed ever since.
								<br />
								<br />
								After three years with Cambridge Community Services, Adrienne realized she needed to take the advice she was giving to
								students: to pursue her dreams, which included continuing to work internationally. So she enrolled at the Fletcher
								School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, focusing on Human Security and Humanitarian Response. This gave her the
								opportunities to complete coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Friedman School of Nutrition, to
								collaborate with students and professors at MIT, and to advise an NGO in Sri Lanka. Upon receiving her Master degree
								from Tufts, Adrienne moved to Kenya, and later Nigeria, to work on famine response with Action Against Hunger.
								<br />
								<br />
								Adrienne next accepted a position at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, within a research center
								focused on lowering homicides through a highly successful framework called “focused deterrence.” While most of her
								coworkers focused primarily on U.S. cities, Adrienne joined the newly minted “international initiative,” working with
								teams across the globe on translating this methodology to the international context, specifically with governments in
								Sweden, Mexico, El Salvador, and Brazil, while also co-advising a portfolio of cities in the U.S. When police shootings
								of Black women and men (specifically Breonna Taylor and George Floyd) gained national attention, Adrienne left the role
								because she did not agree with the way the organization was responding internally or externally. There were other ways
								she knew she could better support the community.
								<br />
								<br />
								While in New York, Adrienne volunteered with the New Sanctuary Coalition, translating asylum applications as part of a
								pro se legal clinic and leading a team of volunteers that went to the Mexican border to meet one of the Migrant Caravans
								and advise them of their legal rights. When the pandemic erupted, she worked with New York’s Medical Reserve Corps on
								the COVID response, spending April in the refrigerated trailers in New York City. She then joined New York City’s Health
								and Hospital’s team as a Public Health Advisor, providing case management to Spanish speaking residents across the city
								who tested positive for COVID 19.
								<br />
								<br />
								When her mother’s Parkinson’s disease worsened, Adrienne moved back to Massachusetts to help support her parents. She
								was thrilled to have the opportunity to move back to Cambridge to work for Mayor Siddiqui. She has worked with Mayor
								Siddiqui for the past three years as the Director of Constituent Services.
								<br />
								<br />
								During this time, Adrienne also married her Argentine husband, with whom she has endured the difficult immigration
								process. When they had their first baby, she became a “heart mom” as their infant son required open-heart surgery. And
								because her husband’s and their son’s first language is Spanish, they’ve also encountered language-access challenges:
								There were no Spanish-speaking midwives at Mount Auburn Hospital where Adrienne chose to deliver, and while hard to
								believe, there are no native Spanish-speaking pediatricians in any practice in Cambridge. Together, they have also
								navigated her husband’s job search as he has worked to improve his English, and he is currently pursuing his dream of
								opening a small business despite minimal resources available for non-native speakers.
								<br />
								<br />
								All of these experiences, so common to our residents in Cambridge — caring for an elder, balancing work responsibilities
								with other roles such as being a wife and mother — combined with her background in social justice and humanitarian work
								overseas and here at home, have led Adrienne to run for City Council. What she dreams of now is helping other
								individuals, children, mothers, and families in Cambridge create a bright future together.
								<br />
								<br />
								Mayor Siddiqui has spearheaded initiatives that Adrienne supports and of which she is proud to be a part, including the
								Cambridge Rise and Rise Up guaranteed income programs, Cambridge Promise, Early College, and Universal Pre-K. The Mayor
								has also advocated for increased affordable housing and inclusion in the city, initiating celebrations that incorporate
								a wider range of identities than previously publicly funded. Adrienne takes inspiration from the Mayor’s leadership, and
								she also sees it as an example for her son of what is possible growing up in Cambridge. Adrienne intends to continue to
								raise her family here, and so she is dedicated to ensuring that Cambridge is as inclusive a city as possible. As a
								candidate, and as a mother and community member, Adrienne’s focuses are family, equal access to resources and justice,
								and leaving the world in a better condition — politically, socially, and environmentally — for her son and for every
								individual in the Cambridge community.
