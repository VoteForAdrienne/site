					<p>
						Adrienne is a dedicated public servant who advocates for inclusive access to infrastructure and
						services including
						housing, transportation, and childcare. Adrienne envisions a Cambridge full of opportunity,
						where locally-owned
						businesses flourish and all residents are represented by their government and service providers.
						Adrienne will fight
						tirelessly for a just legal system and to protect the environment for future generations here in
						Cambridge.
						Find out more about Adrienne’s policy positions below.

					<br>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<h3>Affordable, Abundant, and Stable Housing</h3>
						<p>
							<i>Adrienne and her family have benefited from subsidized housing in Cambridge, and she has
								helped hundreds of residents
								navigate the rental application process and apply for homeownership lotteries.
								<b>Adrienne has fought for landlords and
									property management companies to take on more responsibility. She also supports
									several measures to get creative with
									housing stock.</b></i>
						</p>
						<ul class="hidden">
							<li>
								<b>Revamp Cambridge’s <a
										href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/housing/inclusionaryhousing"
										target="_blank">inclusionary housing programs</a></b> by expanding middle income
								homeownership and creating dedicated support
								and staff for inclusionary housing participants.
							</li>
							<li>
								Adrienne played a major role in holding Harvard and WinnResidential accountable to
								residents living in buildings these
								entities were responsible for. She will continue to find ways to <b>hold developers,
									property managers, and owners
									accountable</b> and incentivize responsible management to keep Cambridge residents
								housed and supported.
							</li>
							<li>
								The <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/zoninganddevelopment/Zoning/Ordinance"
									target="_blank">Zoning Ordinance</a> is an extremely complex compilation of
								regulations. The Affordable Housing Overlay specifically
								addresses some of the restrictions on housing development, but it needs adjustment.
								Adrienne will <b>advocate for zoning
									reform</b> and work with the Council to modify the Affordable Housing Overlay to
								significantly increase the development of
								additional housing units.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>End tenant broker fees</b> to rent an apartment that can add thousands of dollars to
								the cost of finding a place to live in
								Cambridge.
							</li>
							<li>
								Adrienne supports <b>multi-unit home options</b> including the subdivision of larger
								homes and the creation of triple-deckers,
								duplexes, and other apartments in all parts of Cambridge, as well as exploring social
								housing options.
							</li>
							<li>
								Adrienne wants to <b>develop vacant properties</b>, city-owned and otherwise. The City
								must consider <b>purchasing properties</b> as
								an investment and then allowing development on that land while <b>retaining rights to
									the first floor</b>, allowing for
								innovative future programming that could support small businesses.
							</li>
						</ul>

					<ul>
						<h3>Childcare Support and Youth Development</h3>
						<p>
							<i>Adrienne has a toddler in daycare–she knows the costs and has actively researched CPS and
								afterschool programs.
								Adrienne’s first role in Cambridge was working to support immigrants, first generation,
								and students of color through
								Cambridge’s <a href="https://www.enrooteducation.org/" target="_blank">Enroot</a> and <a
									href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/humanserviceprograms/collegesuccess"
									target="_blank">College Success</a> Programs. <b>We want families to be able to
									afford to stay in Cambridge, and we need
									to invest more in this area.</b></i>
						</p>
						<ul class="hidden">
							<li>
								<b>Extend universal pre-K to all 2- and 3-year-olds.</b> <a
									href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/DHSP/newsandevents/News/2023/05/universalpreschoolupdate.aspx"
									target="_blank">The current expansion</a> to 4-year-olds is welcome but doesn’t go
								far
								enough. This is a question of family economics and brain science. We want all
								Cambridge’s children to be exposed to
								developmentally-appropriate, consistent, and nurturing opportunities.
							</li>
							<li>
								Increase Cambridge's local <b>tuition assistance</b> and <a
									href="https://earlychildhoodcambridge.org/for-families/#:~:text=The%20Office%20of%20Early%20Childhood%20Scholarship%20Program,of%20our%20partner%20preschool%20programs."
									target="_blank">scholarship programs</a> to help eligible families find and pay for
								childcare and afterschool.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Strengthen the relationship between School Committee and City Council</b> to better
								coordinate and communicate with parents
								and the community, and to avoid surprises like the removal of <a
									href="https://www.boston.com/news/the-boston-globe/2023/07/18/cambridge-schools-are-divided-over-middle-school-algebra/"
									target="_blank">algebra</a> from the 8th grade curriculum and imminent
								elementary school <a
									href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/185nn938piJEa3BcIgBUVpRbiYuoGH4gM/view"
									target="_blank"></a>scheduling changes.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Expand early college programs.</b> Currently CRLS partners with two higher ed
								institutions and serves around 100 students.
								Early college programs like this are proven to help students of color, first generation
								college students, and immigrants
								graduate earlier and with less debt. Adrienne wants to see this program expand
								exponentially.

						<h3>Transparency and Access to Public Services</h3>
						<p>
							<i>
								Adrienne has helped hundreds of individuals access services in Cambridge, including her
								own family. From subsidized
								housing applications to support paying overdue bills and trying to open a small
								business. <b>She knows the barriers
									residents must overcome to get existing city services, and she knows what services
									that we still need to develop.</b>
							</i>
						</p>
						<ul class="hidden">
							<li>
								Encourage participation in local government through <b>public financing for municipal
									elections</b> and limiting money from
								developers and special interest groups.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Provide additional technical support</b> to diverse residents attempting to access
								services.
							</li>
							<ol>
								<li>
									Institute a municipal IT helpdesk so residents can more easily <b>access city
										services online.</b>
								</li>
								<li>
									Initiate technical assistance programs that <b>connect residents with vendors and
										information</b>, like the newly introduced
									<a href="https://abodeem.com/homeowners/community-programs/cambridge/"
										target="_blank">Electrify Cambridge.</a>
								</li>

									Create a <a

										target="_blank">dedicated housing search position</a> at the <a
										href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/Services/HomelessandEvictionPreventionServices"
										target="_blank">Multi-Service Center</a> to work with the homeless population.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<li>
								<b>Translate City materials (forms, guides, applications) into multiple languages.</b>
								The City currently has abundant
								resources, but they are rarely available in the <a
									href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/cdd/factsandmaps/demographicfaq">diverse languages
									our residents speak.</a> Adrienne would advocate starting
								with the Community Development Department’s resources which include housing and business
								opportunities, and then
								expanding rapidly to create fully accessible external facing materials.
							</li>
							<li>
								Adrienne is committed to <b>intentional, ongoing engagement with non-native English
									speakers, youth, and seniors</b> to ensure
								they have full access to the resources and services of the city.
							</li>

						<h3>Business and Workforce Development</h3>
						<p>
							<i>
								Adrienne’s husband is an aspiring entrepreneur who has worked at small businesses here
								in Cambridge. She lives in a
								neighborhood full of long-standing shops and too many empty storefronts. <b>She wants to
									see a thriving, bustling, and
									diverse economy, where residents can access the goods and services they need while
									supporting our local businesses. To
									achieve that we need to improve communication with small businesses and expand
									resources to support an evolving city.</b>
							</i>
						</p>
						<ul class="hidden">
							<li>
								Assist business owners struggling to keep up with the rising costs of operating in
								Cambridge by creating <b>inclusive
									zoning for businesses</b> and exploring City administered grants and 0% interest
								loans.
							</li>
							<li>
								Make Cambridge an easier place to do business by <a
									href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/zoninganddevelopment/Zoning/Maps"
									target="_blank">updating zoning tables</a> to <b>support the creation of more
									businesses and
									affordable housing</b> and allow for a wider variety of businesses to operate in
								Cambridge.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Promote equity in City contracts</b> by advocating for a percentage of City contracts
								to be set aside for diverse
								businesses, building on the <a href="https://cambridgemadisparitystudy.com/"
									target="_blank">spending disparity study</a> of awarded contracts.
							</li>
							<li>
								Adrienne <b>unequivocally supports union jobs</b> as well as expanding local training
								programs and partnerships. Cambridge is lucky
								to have robust training programs run by city departments and local nonprofit
								organizations that can be supplemented.
							</li>
						</ul>

					<ul>
						<h3>Justice for All</h3>
						<p>
							<i>
								<b>Rooted in her years working toward justice,</b> Adrienne has a strong vision to
								transform the existing justice mechanisms
								into a model that works for everyone. She is committed to deterrence and positive
								reinforcement—not just punitive
								measures—through improving communication and trust between citizens and local
								government.
							</i>
						</p>
						<ul class="hidden">
							<li>
								<b>Facilitate Police-Community Reconciliation</b>. At the National Network for Safe
								Communities, Adrienne’s colleagues
								developed the <a
									href="https://nnscommunities.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Reconciliation-Issue-Brief.pdf"
									target="_blank">Police-Community Reconciliation</a> method. This is one way to help
								address the recent police shooting of Arif
								Sayed Faisal, and it is also necessary to continue the hard work to improve trust in our
								law enforcement and justice
								institutions.
							</li>
							<li>
								Adrienne has had the opportunity to work with members of the Holistic Emergency
								Alternative Response Team (HEART), she
								respects their work and <a
									href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/3/9/councilors-police-alternative-proposal/"
									target="_blank">supports funding them</a> and introducing additional <b>alternative
									public safety models</b> like the
								City’s Community Safety Department.
							</li>
						</ul>

					<ul>
						<h3>Accessible Infrastructure</h3>
						<p>
							<i>
								Adrienne started biking to work in Cambridge 10 years ago, even biking to work every day
								during her pregnancy. And she
								regularly uses the subway and the bus system. <b>Adrienne will advocate for inclusive
									access to infrastructure, and is
									unafraid to support a more walkable city, building on the <a
										href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/streetsandtransportation/policiesordinancesandplans/visionzero"
										target="_blank">Vision Zero</a> policy already in place.</b>
							</i>
						</p>
						<ul class="hidden">
							<li>
								Building near transit allows the City to create the needed units to house our growing
								population, while also providing
								the environmental benefit of reducing single-car trips. It is key to promote
								<b>transit-oriented development</b> in balance and
								consultation with the needs of any neighborhood around specific development projects.
							</li>
							<li>
								Adrienne has signed a <a href="https://www.cambridgebikesafety.org/election/"
									target="_blank">pledge</a> to support a connected and <b>protected bike network</b>.
								She wants ongoing development of bike
								infrastructure that works for all residents and is rolled out with proper communication
								and instituted with common
								sense, including <b>data-driven examination of the impact</b> on the lives of residents
								and businesses brought about by the
								changes in street use.
							</li>
							<li>
								Many of Cambridge's residents rely on public transit, and recent interruptions in
								service and high fares are making
								public transit increasingly inaccessible. Adrienne fully supports the City’s efforts to
								explore a <a
									href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/mayorsoffice/farefreeworkinggroup"
									target="_blank">fare-free bus pilot</a>,
								while supporting similar state-level efforts to promote transit justice and align with
								the City's environmental goals.

						<h3>Climate Action</h3>
						<p>
							<i>As a mother, Adrienne takes climate change seriously and looks to continue to push
								Cambridge to take innovative action
								and lead the country and world to a more sustainable future for the next generation. The
								support for continued shift
								towards public transit and cycling advocated above is part of the climate responsible
								approach Adrienne is unafraid to
								support for a more walkable city. <b>She will continue current programs and look for
									ways to expand their impact.</b></i>
						</p>
						<ul class="hidden">
							<li>
								Find ways to keep and <b>expand our tree canopy collaboratively</b>. The city can look
								to increase tree canopy on city-owned
								land (e.g., street trees, public parks, etc.) and continue to work with homeowners to
								plant more trees by providing
								positive incentives.
							</li>
							<li>
								The current <b>recycling and the compost program</b> (which completes its fifth
								anniversary this year) are a good start and we
								should look to expand them.
							</li>
							<li>
								Support participation in the <a
									href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/zoninganddevelopment/sustainabledevelopment/fossilfuelfreedemo"
									target="_blank">Fossil Fuel Free Demonstration Program</a>, <a
									href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/news/2023/07/electrifycambridgetosupportresidentswithclean,allelectrichomeupgrades"
									target="_blank">Electrify Cambridge</a>, and the recently passed <a
									href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/zoninganddevelopment/sustainabledevelopment/buildingenergydisclosureordinance"
									target="_blank">BEUDO
									modifications</a> to <b>align Cambridge building emissions regulations</b> with
								climate goals.
